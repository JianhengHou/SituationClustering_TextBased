# Text Based Situation Clustering in Real-time
Unlike other offline clustering algorithms, models here are used to cluster tweets, messages, or texts during disasters in real-time. Tweets in different situations would be divided into their coressponding clusters based on the content of messages. At the end, one can do quiry on some tweets and to see related tweets in the same situation.

## Getting Started

Models are implemented under python 2.7.*. There are some denpendency and packages needed before running it.

### Prerequisites

One pre-trained Word2Vec word embedding is used in models here. Essentially, this word embedding was trained on tweets of 19 natural and man-made disasters datasets, which is a relatively general word wmbedding for processing tweets during diasters. 

Just simply refer to this link to download and put it under the SituationClustering_TextBased file.

### Installing

gensim tool should be installed if it is not in your python packages. To do in terminal:

```
- pip install gensim
```

## Usage
The model takes .txt file, in which all data represents as json lines in time sequence, as the input. Meanwhile, one should specify the output file as one runs the model. 

There is another optional parameter, -stop_point, which is used to specify the number of tweets to be processed in the model. All tweets would be computed by default, if one do not want to set up stop point. 

Last parameter is to specify the model name you'd use: One is "DynamicClustering", the other is "EvolutionaryClustering". 

### Example
If all tweets need to be processed, commend in terminal should be like this:

	python SituationClustering.py -input input_sample.txt -output output_all.txt -model_name DynamicClustering
	
If one wants to set stop point to run the code, commend in terminal should be like this:

	python SituationClustering.py -input input_sample.txt -output output_stop_point.txt -stop_point 2000 -model_name DynamicClustering
